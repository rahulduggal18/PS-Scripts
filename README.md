# PS-Scripts

Collection of multiple scripts, utilities and tools under one directory.

## 1. SystemInventory

A Power Shell script/tool that collects critical info about servers and emails the report.

The following information is gathered :

* Computer Information like RAM, OS, Processor (with Pie-Chart)
* Top 10 Running Processes
* List of Shared Folders
* Disk-Info showing disks having Low Disk space (less than 20%,configurable)
* List of all Services that are Automatic but Stopped.

The initial source of the script is <i>https://www.simple-talk.com/content/article.aspx?article=1459.</i>

However, this script is <b>optimised using PowerShell remoting </b>, so it gives very good performance. 
Also, it has Error Handling and some other features.

### Future Features   (Please Contribute)

* Pending Patches / Windows Updates
